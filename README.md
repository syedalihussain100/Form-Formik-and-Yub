Deatils Yub:   

Yup
Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations, or value transformations.

Yup's API is heavily inspired by Joi, but leaner and built with client-side validation as its primary use-case. Yup separates the parsing and validating functions into separate steps. cast() transforms data while validate checks that the input is the correct shape. Each can be performed together (such as HTML form validation) or seperately (such as deserializing trusted data from APIs).



install Yub:   npm i yup
